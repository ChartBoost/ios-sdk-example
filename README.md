# Chartboost SDK for iOS

*Version 8.1.0*

The Chartboost iOS SDK is the cornerstone of the Chartboost network. It
provides the functionality for showing interstitial, rewarded and banner ads.


## Usage
1. Before you begin:
 - [Have you signed up for a Chartboost account?](https://www.chartboost.com/signup/)
 - [Did you add an app to your dashboard?](https://answers.chartboost.com/hc/en-us/articles/200797729)
 - [Did you download the latest SDK?](https://answers.chartboost.com/en-us/articles/download)
 - [Do you have an active publishing campaign?](https://answers.chartboost.com/hc/en-us/articles/200797729)
 - Note only iOS 9.0 or higher is supported.

2. Link the Chartboost.framework to your project, or use CocoaPods to manage the framework dependency for you.

3. Link the `StoreKit` and `WebKit` frameworks.

4. Add value "-ObjC" in "Other Linker Flags" for both Debug and Release.

5. Add the import header `#import <Chartboost/Chartboost.h>` to your AppDelegate.m file.

6. Initialize Chartboost in your `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method.
```
(BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
    // Initialize the Chartboost library
    [Chartboost startWithAppId:@"YOUR_CHARTBOOST_APP_ID"
                  appSignature:@"YOUR_CHARTBOOST_APP_SIGNATURE"
                    completion:^(BOOL initialized) {
                        NSLog(@"Chartboost SDK initialization finished with success %i", initialized);
                    }];
    return YES;
}
```

 **Please note:**
 - `startWithAppId:appSignature:completion:` must always be called on bootup, no matter what other actions your app takes.

7. Add your app ID and app signature.
    - Replace `YOUR_CHARTBOOST_APP_ID` and `YOUR_CHARTBOOST_APP_SIGNATURE` with your app ID and app signature.
    - [Where can I find my app ID and app signature?](https://answers.chartboost.com/en-us/articles/209981506#appidappsign)

8. Learn how to load and show ads with Chartboost SDK.
 - Check out our Example app (more info below).
 - Read the headers included in the Chartboost framework. They contain detailed explanations and code examples. See `Chartboost.h`, `CHBInterstitial.h`, `CHBRewarded.h`, `CHBBanner.h` and `CHBAdDelegate.h`. 
 - Check our [online documentation](https://answers.chartboost.com/en-us/child_article/ios) to learn more.

9. Test your integration.
    - Build and run your project from Xcode on a device or Simulator.
    - [If you have an active publishing campaign and have integrated "show interstitial" or "show rewarded video" calls, you should see live ads.] (https://answers.chartboost.com/hc/en-us/articles/204930539)
    - [If you don't have any publishing campaigns and you've still integrated these calls, you can use Test Mode to see if test ads show up.](https://answers.chartboost.com/hc/en-us/articles/200780549)
    - [Why can't I see ads in my game?](https://answers.chartboost.com/en-us/articles/209981506#cantseeads)

10. Check the SDK icon in the Chartboost dashboard.
    - Go to your app's App Settings > Basic Settings in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.chartboost.com/).
    - When our servers successfully receive a bootup call from our SDK using your app ID, the SDK icon underneath your app’s icon will turn from gray to green.


# Example App

Our [example app](http://github.com/ChartBoost/ios-sdk-example/) showcases how to integrate the [Chartboost SDK](https://answers.chartboost.com/en-us/child_article/ios). 

## Versions

The `master` branch includes the example app supporting the latest version of the Chartboost SDK.

For previous SDK versions check out the other branches.

## Targets

The ChartboostExample project includes two targets: 

- `ChartboostExample`: Manual dependency management. 

It requires the `Chartboost.framework`, which is already in the root directory (where this readme is) and linked to the Xcode project.
You can download the latest version of the Chartboost SDK [here](http://www.chartboo.st/sdk/ios).

- `ChartboostExample-Pods`: CocoaPods dependency management. 

 Just go into the project directory and run `pod install`.
